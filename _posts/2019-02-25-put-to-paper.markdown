Having time to think is a powerful resource, but, like any other tool, is only useful when directed towards a goal. While I often put focus my mind on work or my relationships, there is only so much to productively ponder about. In that light, I decided to begin these... things. I suppose it's a blog? Yet that word feels awfully outdated at time of this time of writing. In any case, I plan to work on some writing for here every day to the best of my capacity.

Currently, this likely means squeezing in 10 minutes here and there to work on something. I'll suffer the low quality of this post in order to get something out there, but my future posts will be more thought out.
